# My-Journal

## Description
My-Journal is a web application that allows users to create personal journal entries, which they can then either keep private or make public. Other users can also view the shared entries tab and see what other users have posted. Created using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack during the winter of 2021-2022 solely by Patrick Chen.
